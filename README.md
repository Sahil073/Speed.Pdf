I recently developed a Python-based automation tool that seamlessly captures multiple screenshots of a scrolling page and converts them into a single PDF document. This project leverages PyAutoGUI, FPDF, and Tkinter to create an efficient, user-friendly experience.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Automated Screenshot Capture – Users can specify the number of screenshots they need, and the tool captures them one by one.
✅ Smart Scrolling Mechanism – The program attempts different scrolling methods to ensure smooth capture.
✅ Instant PDF Conversion – All screenshots are compiled into an A4-sized PDF for easy storage and sharing.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to interact effortlessly.
✅ Custom PDF Naming & Folder Organization – The tool creates a dedicated folder and saves the PDF with a user-defined name.

💡 How It Works:
1️⃣ Enter the number of pages (screenshots) required.
2️⃣ Provide a name for the final PDF file.
3️⃣ Switch to the desired window (e.g., an article, chat, or document).
4️⃣ The tool captures screenshots, scrolls automatically, and saves them.
5️⃣ Finally, all images are converted into a single PDF!

🖥️ Python | | 📂 OS & File Handling

This project is extremely useful for capturing long-form content such as articles, e-books, chat histories, and web pages without manual effort. 🚀

🔗 Looking forward to feedback and suggestions! Also, open to discussing potential enhancements like OCR for searchable PDFs or adding cloud storage integration.

Would love to hear your thoughts! 😊👨‍💻
